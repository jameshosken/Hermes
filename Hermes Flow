Netflow for IM Project Hermes

Arduino/client side:

	BillySocketIO

	Custom library/package that handles connections? Like a module with module.connect(), module.start() to network.

	- ON CONNECTION: Send identification/name
		(EDGECASE: maybe server determines order?)

	- Wait for start flag
	- ~do your thang~
	- Send End Flag



Server side:

	Start server.

	Listen for Begin{number} message. {number} will identify how may connections to wait for.

	Listen for connections, create list of connections, (sort?).

	Once connections == {number}, stop listening and start doing.


	currentDevice == 0;


	send startMessage to currentDevice.

	loop(){
		//maybe broadcast currentDevice;

		listen for endMessage();

		onMessage(endMessage()){
			currentDevice += 1
		}
	}
